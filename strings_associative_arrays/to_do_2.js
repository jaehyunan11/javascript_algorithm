// To Do 2
// Reverse
// Implement reverseString(str) that, given string, returns that string with characters reversed.

// Given "creature", return "erutaerc". Tempting as it seems, do not use the built-in reverse()!



// Remove Even-Length Strings
// Build a standalone function to remove strings of even lengths from a given array. For array containing

// ["Nope!","Its","Kris","starting","with","K!","(instead","of","Chris","with","C)","."], change that same array to ["Nope!","Its","Chris","."].



// Integer to Roman Numerals
// Given a positive integer that is less than 4000, return a string containing that value in Roman numeral representation. 
// In this representation, I is 1, V is 5, X is 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500, and M = 1000. Remember that 4 is IV, 349 is CCCIL and 444 is CDXLIV.

// Roman Numerals to Integer
// Sept 16, 2014 headline: “Ancient Computer Found in Roman Shipwreck”. Comprising 30 bronze gears, its wooden frame features 2000 characters.
